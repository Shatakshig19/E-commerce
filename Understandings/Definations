# Toaster :
ðŸ”¹ Toaster is coming from the react-hot-toast library, and it is used to display toast notifications in your React app.
ðŸ”¹ Toast notifications are small pop-up messages that appear temporarily to show feedback like success, error, or warning messages.
The <Toaster /> component is included in your App.js, meaning that it is available throughout your entire application.
Whenever you trigger a toast message, it will automatically be shown on the screen.


# BrowserRouter
<BrowserRouter> is part of React Router, a library used for handling navigation (URLs) in React apps.

âš¡ What Does BrowserRouter Do?
âœ… It enables client-side routing (changing pages without reloading).
âœ… It makes React listen to URL changes and load components accordingly.
âœ… It wraps your app so that routes work properly (<Route path="/" element={<Home />} />).

# StrictMode
runs the code twice but does not stop our code from running. It only shows warnings in the console.
